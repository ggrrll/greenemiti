# Abstract


Tremiti islands have always had issues with basic supplies like electricity or water. The general purpose of this project is combine these needs with the reduction of CO2 emissions from the main activities of the islands.

# Description

The general idea, is to provide renewable energy to Tremiti islands, by PV power plant(s).

In this proposal, we provide a rough estimate of the annual energetic need of the islands and we propose three areas were PV station(s) could be installed. 
We also suggest water desalination as first useful solution to energy storage.

More details are provided in the attached PDF.

# Criticalities


There are already outstanding bureaucratical/administrative issues on the islands, given for instance that a water desalination plan was been already approved in 2016, but it hasn't been built yet. 
This type of issues, (currently) out of our control, seem to be higher than technical ones, given that we are proposing to use anyway technologies that are already available on the market since years

Further resources, will have to be found to initiate/speed-up the adoption of electric vehicles.

# Advantages

* CO2 neutrality (less pollution + economic savings)

* independence from mainland on fuels, water and other basic supplies, like salt, as byproduct of desalination (probably, also the production of other basic goods, like few types of fruits or vegetables might be triggered or improved, by the increased availability of electricity and fresh water)

# Competitors

Probably the local company, currently providing electricity https://www.germano-srl.it/
